# evolution-simulator
A  moderatly simple simulator of chemistry, cellular organisms and natural selection with a basic graphic output. Made in python and currently in early development.

The worlds created are saved in the saves folder and have some components stored in json files (like the element list or the world matrix) that are editable manually for now, whilst others (like the world size) needs to be modified with the program world_generator.py.
The main program, being the one designed for user input and the only with a graphic output, is evolution_simulator.py where you can load worlds and see the progress overtime (for now there are is no way to interact with the world since the update cycle is still wip).
